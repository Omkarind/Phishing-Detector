Phishing and Url is a common cyber-attack where attackers trick users into visiting fraudulent websites to steal sensitive information. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze features extracted from URLs (such as length, presence of special characters, use of HTTPS, domain age, etc.) and predict whether a given URL is safe or malicious. The system can be deployed as a web application, browser extension, or API.

*Outcome Obtained (Detailed)
Accurate Phishing Detection Model:
A machine learning model capable of distinguishing phishing URLs from legitimate ones with high accuracy (e.g., >95%).

User Application or API:
A web interface, desktop app, or REST API where users can input URLs and receive instant feedback on their safety.

Feature Importance Analysis:
Insights into which URL features are most indicative of phishing, aiding further research and model improvement.

Performance Metrics:
Comprehensive evaluation reports (confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision, recall, F1-score) demonstrating the model’s effectiveness.

Documentation:
User manuals, API documentation, and developer guides for future maintenance and upgrades.

Security Enhancement:
Direct contribution to user safety by reducing the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.

Scalability:
The system can be integrated into larger security solutions, browser extensions, or enterprise security products.

Summary:
This project brings together data science, software engineering, and cybersecurity to deliver a practical tool for phishing prevention. The collaborative effort of various roles ensures a robust, user-friendly, and effective solution.
